# BVE-Reborn

Welcome to the documentation site of BVE-Reborn, the successor train simulator to OpenBVE. Most of this site will be about how to program against the libraries that make up the project, but there will also be a section about tips and tricks for making routes/plugins to the game.

# Playing

If you just want to play the game, you can download executables on the download site (coming soon). The game will come with a single sample route and train.

# Building

If you want to build the game yourself, either to develop against it, or to contribute, you can go to the [building](\ref dev-building) page for instructions.
